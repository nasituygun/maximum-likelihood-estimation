# Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation
This project uses the "German Credit Data" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)) to make predictions using the 'Duration' and 'Credit amount' columns. The maximum-likelihood-estimation method is used for this purpose.

## Requirements
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

## Results
The results of the predictions are visualized using matplotlib. The results will show a scatter plot of the 'Duration' and 'Credit amount' columns, with different colors representing different predictions.
